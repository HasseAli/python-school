# ===========================================================
# TASK:
# Marko and Samir need your help!
#
# Write a Python script that:
# - Asks the user: "What is the multiplied value of 12 and 13?"
# - If the answer is correct (156), print "Correct!"
# - If the answer is incorrect, print "Computer says NO!"
#
# Try to implement this logic yourself before scrolling down.

value = float(input("What is the multiplied value of 12 and 13? "))
if value == 156:
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print("Computer says NO!")
